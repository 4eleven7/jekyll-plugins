Various Jekyll Plugins
========
If you don't have a *_plugins* folder within your site, you'll need to create one. Place each of the *.rb* files within the *_plugins* folder to get started.

### Installation
Place **indent_markup.rb** in the *_plugins* folder, within your site. Create this folder if it doesn't exist.

### Usage	
There are two convenience methods, `indent_tab` and `indent_space`, depending on your indenting preferences.  
In this example, we indent by 1 tab.	  
`{{ content | indent_tab: 1 }}`

Or we can indent by 1 space.  
`{{ content | indent_space: 1 }}`

The default indentation is 1 tab, however we can customise this and use a line break ("<br/>") or 4 spaces.  
`{{ content | indent: 2, "<br>" }}`

By default, the first line is ignored.
This is because usually the tag has been indented to the correct level, and the content will inherit that level. However if this isnâ€™t the case, you can set `ignoreFirstLine` to `false`.  
`{{ content | indent: 2, " ", false }}`


# Whitespace
**clean_markup** helps to remove whitespace.

### Installation

### Usage	
Remove leading whitespace " test " becomes "test "  
`{{ content | trim_leading_whitespace }}`

Remove trailing whitespace " test " becomes " test"  
`{{ content | trim_trailing_whitespace }}`

Remove leading and trailing whitespace " test " becomes "test"
